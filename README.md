# EscapeVelocity-Physics
This Python program simulates a rocket launch by calculating the forces needed for a rocket to escape Earth's gravity. The user provides the mass of the rocket and the time required to reach escape velocity, and the program outputs the necessary forces and acceleration for liftoff.
