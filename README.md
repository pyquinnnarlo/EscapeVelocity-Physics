# ðŸš€ Rocket Launch Simulation

This Python program simulates a rocket launch by calculating the forces needed for a rocket to escape Earth's gravity. The user provides the mass of the rocket and the time required to reach escape velocity, and the program outputs the necessary forces and acceleration for liftoff.

## Features
- Calculates gravitational force based on the rocket's mass.
- Determines the acceleration required to reach escape velocity.
- Outputs the total force required for a successful launch.
- Displays rocket ASCII art and a countdown to simulate a liftoff.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rocket-launch-simulation.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd rocket-launch-simulation
   ```

3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python rocket_launch.py
   ```

## Usage

When you run the script, you'll be asked to enter:
- The mass of the rocket in kilograms (kg).
- The time in seconds to reach escape velocity.

### Example:

```
Enter the mass of the rocket (kg): 50000
Enter the time to reach escape velocity (s): 300
```

After entering the values, the program will output the following:

- Gravitational Force: The weight of the rocket.
- Required Acceleration: The acceleration needed to reach escape velocity.
- Force Needed for Acceleration: The force required to achieve the acceleration.
- Total Force Required to Escape Earth's Gravity.

### Sample Output:

```
*** LIFTOFF! ***

Results for a rocket with mass 50000 kg:
Gravitational Force: 490500.00 N
Required Acceleration: 37.33 m/s^2
Force Needed for Acceleration: 1866500.00 N
Total Force Required to Escape Earth's Gravity: 2357000.00 N

The rocket is blasting off!

## Constants

- **g:** Acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/sÂ²).
- **Escape Velocity:** 11200 m/s (the velocity needed to escape Earth's gravitational pull).
